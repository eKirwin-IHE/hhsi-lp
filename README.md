Linear programming for synthesized horizontal health system intervention optimization


This is an app to provide examples for Chapter 2 of my PhD thesis. The app demonstrates why a synthesized HSSI optimization is required, and demonstrates how sub-optimal allocation ocurrs when one type of HSSI is not considered, or when different types of HSSI are evaluated seperately.
